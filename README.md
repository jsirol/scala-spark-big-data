# scala-spark-big-data
Coursera course on big data analysis using Scala and Spark [website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data).

## Running
You will likely need to have JDK 8 installed. If you have multiple JDK's installed, create an env variable `JAVA_HOMES` that points to the root of all the JDK installs and add that to `PATH`. Additionally, you will need to add a file `.java-version` to the project root which contains the subfolder for the JDK 8 installation.

Once set up, you should be able to run the projects with `sbt run` from the project root.
